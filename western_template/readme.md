###About the Western Standard Template###

We have updated the Western Template to closely match the style of the Western homepage. During fall term 2011 ATUS began retrofitting sites on the old template to the new look. Those who request a new site on the campus servers will automatically be provided with the new template as well.

ATUS believes that as departmental webmasters your obligation is to provide accurate content rather than perform custom design from scratch. This template should allow you to concentrate on your content while getting the benefits of matching the new Western look. 

More information can be found on the [ATUS site](http://west.wwu.edu/atus/web/templates.shtml).
