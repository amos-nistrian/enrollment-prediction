The Western Template uses "Muli," an open-source font available from Google. Visitors to your site will automatically load the font from Google's servers. However, you most likely will not have the font available on your computer when editing your banner with Photoshop. If you have administrator privileges on your working computer, you can install these font files and use Muli in Photoshop. This will match the text in your banner to the rest of the text on your site.
